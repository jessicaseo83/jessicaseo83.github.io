## Fun Facts About Me

1. I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. I moved to Toronto 5 years ago.
2. I love **GREEN/GOLD COLOURED ITEMS**. You can always find something green or gold around me.
3. I like to try new things. Learning new languages, tasting new wines, trying new restaurants/foods, and buying new things(of course!)...etc.
4. I love travelling(Before COVID-19 era...). My favourite city so far is **Budapest**. Everything was PERFECT! My second home is **San Francisco**. I used to live near Ocean beach. I like 49ers.
5. I was a flower shop manager in downtown Toronto before joining the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs(pre-COVID 19). **Tip💡** There are many romantic flowers that area’t red roses :-p.
